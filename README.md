## What is this?
This is a GitHub Repo of my script addons for NuclearCraft: Overhauled. Issues and Suggestions for the addons are tracked here.
The addons aim to enhance your NCO experience by adding various blocks and multiblock components and other QOL stuff via the magic of CraftTweaker and ContentTweaker!

## What do I need to run the addons?
1) Latest version of NuclearCraft: Overhauled
2) CraftTweaker, B.A.S.E., ContentTweaker, and any other dependencies these mods may have.
3) My addons also provide additional content and mod integrations in case said mods are installed.
These mods are, but not limited to: QMD, Trinity, Thermal series, Ender IO, Immersive Engineering, Tinkers' Construct and Pam's HarvestCraft.
Feel free to suggest more integrations or help me improve existing integrations if I have missed them!

__*WARNING:* Some mod integrations require additional library mods (eg. Thermal and TiC require ModTweaker, EIO requires EnderTweaker)__

4) Once you have the above, get the addon .zip either from here or the CurseForge pages of each addon, drag it over to your Minecraft instance's /resources/nuclearcraft/addons folder, and then launch the game!
